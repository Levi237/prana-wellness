            content: "Most people are unaware of the power they possess within their own body to heal itself. Yoga Therapy is a personal, tailored approach to healing both mental and physical challenges. It is the perfect marriage of Eastern and Western medicine, and an alternative to traditional methods. Every session with me, you will feel safe and free to exist in your own body and in your personal truth. Yoga Therapy is specific and focused, using traditional practices to address health challenges, reduce symptoms, restore balance, manage a condition, increase vitality, and improve mental health.",
